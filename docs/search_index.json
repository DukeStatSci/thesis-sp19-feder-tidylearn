["5-methods.html", "Chapter 5 Methods 5.1 Creativity 5.2 Depth", " Chapter 5 Methods Since 98 percent of the projects were submitted either as an R script or R Markdown document, the student project code could be analyzed directly on their downloaded submission documents. Each project was examined and coded as either a 0, if the attribute was missing, or 1, if it was present, for 16 variables. The remaining three covariates identified the student projects by grade, index, and class. Due to privacy concerns, since the project submissions often contained the members of the project group, each student project was provided with an index, and the names of the students in each group were removed from their submission document. For the dataset utilized in this thesis, projects can solely be identified by their assigned index. A separate dataset serves as a link between the individual projects and their titles. The first few rows of the dataset compiled in this project are available below. head(project) # A tibble: 6 x 21 index grade sem r_rmd tidyverse create_new_var change_var sub_analysis &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 87.1 Fall… .r base R no no yes 2 2 89.2 Fall… .r base R yes no yes 3 3 80.2 Fall… .r base R no no yes 4 4 87.2 Fall… .r base R yes no yes 5 5 80.4 Fall… .r base R no no yes 6 6 (h… 75.9 Fall… .r base R &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; no # … with 13 more variables: sub_data &lt;chr&gt;, viz_mult_mak &lt;chr&gt;, # viz_mult_interpret &lt;chr&gt;, eda_theme &lt;chr&gt;, rel_data &lt;chr&gt;, # slr_fit &lt;chr&gt;, mlr_fit &lt;chr&gt;, mlr_check_cond &lt;chr&gt;, prediction &lt;chr&gt;, # ht &lt;chr&gt;, ht_check_cond &lt;chr&gt;, creative &lt;dbl&gt;, theme &lt;int&gt; The student projects were not compiled into PDF or HTML files to confirm that the code worked, since it was a near-impossible task to determine which version of R packages the students utilized, as some of these commands are now defunct in the most recent versions of the packages. Because of this decision, this analysis operates under the assumption that the code produced the desired results in each project and did not require further debugging. The contents of the student project code were still analyzed for clarity, as well as creativeness and depth through the 16 indicator variables. index: Project ID grade: Score on final project sem: Semester course taken r_rmd: Was the submission an R script (with prose of the project turned in as a Word document) or was the submission an R Markdown file? tidyverse: Project used &quot;tidyverse&quot; or &quot;base R&quot; syntax create_new_var: Students created a new variable based on existing variables, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, change_var: hello sub_analysis: hello sub_data: hello viz_mult_mak: hello viz_mult_interpret: hello eda_theme: hello rel_data: hello slr_fit: hello mlr_fit: hello mlr_check_cond: hello prediction: hello ht: hello ht_check_cond: hello 5.1 Creativity The creativity metric seeks to encapsulate anything students coded that was not directly specified in the instructions but provided a purpose in their projects. The metric’s possible scores range from 0 to 4, as a project is scored with a single point for each of the following: Creation of new variable(s) based on existing variables Transformation of existing variables Existence of a subgroup analysis The use of a subset of the dataset for all steps of the project In the case of the student group projects utilizing the Tidyverse syntax, groups were still given scores of ones if they satisfied these conditions in Base R form. While rare, two (NEED TO CONFIRM) groups in labs taught in the Tidyverse created or transformed covariates using Base R syntax, which was likely due to alternative resources, such as Stack Overflow, that at the time, did not contain many Tidyverse solutions. Now, though, as the Tidyverse’s popularity continues to grow, more online resources incorporate and promote Tidyverse solutions. 5.1.1 Creation of New Variable(s) The creation of a new variable(s) is defined as any data manipulation throughout the EDA process where student groups compose a previously non-existing covariate. As an example, one project created a new variable tracking if a movie had won any of the following awards: best picture, best actor, best actress, or best director, and that project had this variable coded as “yes.” In order to score a 1, the student project also had to utilize the new variable within an aspect of their analysis. This condition filtered for groups that created unnecessary covariates. However, a score of 1 would be valid if the group did not use the variable in the inference or regression sections, but did explore the covariate in their EDA. 5.1.2 Transformation of Existing Variables Although related to the above covariate, the transformation of existing variables did not qualify as creating new variables, or vice versa. In this situation, a project would score a one if the student group mutated a variable already existing within the dataset, generally to highlight certain cases. For instance, a few project groups decided to change mpaa_rating to either “R” or “Other,” if the movie was not rated R. Similar to the requirements for scoring a one for the creation of new variable(s) covariate, the mutation was required to be employed to some end, as groups would have to provide at least a cursory analysis of the newly-mutated variable to score a one. A distinction between scoring a one for this covariate and one for subsetting the dataset or conducting a subgroup analysis is that filtering the dataset for just entries that cover a portion of levels within a specific variable would qualify as a part of either a subgroup analysis or data subset, but not this covariate. Also, converting a factor variable that could be potentially read in as one when loading the dataset did not qualify as a mutation of an existing variable for this study. 5.1.3 Existence of Subgroup Analysis The presence of a subgroup analysis was measured in regards to creativity. Projects that received a one analyzed portions of the data during their EDA process. Groups could use an assortment of commands to satisfy a score of a 1, such as a normal boxplot, five-number summary of a specific variable within the movies dataset, or a subsetting with a corresponding numerical or graphical analysis. As an example, a project receiving a one for this category may have analyzed how the audience ratings for R rated movies compared to that of PG-13 movies in their bivariate analysis. 5.1.4 Use of a Data Subset for Project’s Entirety Although the use of a data subset covariate may seem similar to the one above, this variable received a one for a different aspect of the final group projects. Here, student groups are not just using the provided movies dataset for their EDA, inference, and regression—they are intentionally focusing on a few characteristics of the movie dataset. Student projects were not required to employ the same subsetted data throughout the entire analysis, but they did have to analyze related aspects of the movies dataset to qualify for a one. For example, one student group scrutinized solely PG-13 rated movies for their final project, while another used the PG-13 rated movies subset for the EDA, PG-13 movies released after 2000 for the inference, and then the same PG-13 rated movies subset utilized in the EDA process for their regression analysis. 5.2 Depth The depth metric measures the level of depth of the analysis, both in terms of the statistical methods utilized and in terms of story-telling. The metric ranges from 0-2 and is scored with 1 point for each of the following: Presence of consistent theme throughout the project Use of relevant data The depth metric was created to qualify findings from the creativity score, to confirm that the syntax producing the more creative student projects also were of the same (or better) quality. Although creativity is imperative in these final projects, student groups also cannot skip parts of the data analysis cycle. 5.2.1 Consistent Theme In the world of data science, story-telling is such an important aspect, just as story-telling is designed to be for the STA 101 final group projects. A strong final project requires a story: a leading question, initial findings, subsequent analyses, and conclusion, all formed around a specific theme. Although this covariate’s scoring was subjective, the requirements for final projects to score a one were similar to those defining the creativity metric. To receive a one, student groups clearly linked the steps in their analysis, often choosing to focus on a few aspects within the entire movie dataset. For instance, analyzing the impact of movie ratings on audience scores would qualify as a sufficient theme, but referencing an assortment of different predictors would not register as one. 5.2.2 Presence of Relevant Data Another subjective variable, the presence of relevant data was formed to complement the consistent theme covariate. To receive a one for this variable, student groups were required to sufficiently use R to create insights surrounding their chosen theme(s). The covariate addresses the issue that projects may have interesting themes but lack the analysis and coding quality to supplement their project. As an example, an aspect of a group project that would have scored a one for this category would have displayed the correlation coefficient between two numerical variables instead of plotting them together and failing to acknowledge the figure in the project submission. If the majority of the coding could be employed to support the final project, the project group received a one. "],
["6-results.html", "Chapter 6 Results 6.1 Creativity Metric", " Chapter 6 Results Both numerically and graphically, the student projects using the tidyverse syntax in this setting score higher on the creativity and depth metrics. Tidyverse projects overwhelmingly score higher in the upper levels of the two variables, and their mean and standard deviations are significantly different: [TO DO FROM MINE: Move to respective sections, and add a similar table for multivariate visualizations.] Creativity: Syntax | Mean | Standard Deviation ——— | —– ————- Base R | 1.1 | .6 Tidyverse | 1.7 | .8 Depth: Syntax | Mean | Standard Deviation ——— | —– ————- Base R | 1.2 | .7 Tidyverse | 1.4 | .7 6.1 Creativity Metric Despite there being only 82 base R projects recorded to the 123 Tidyverse projects, there still were more base R projects scoring a 0 or 1 on the creativity metric than those within the Tidyverse. Overall, there was a single project that scored a perfect four, and the majority of the total projects scored a one or two. Yet within the Tidyverse projects, more than half (56.1 percent) registered at least a two on creativity, compared to just 20.7 percent of base R final projects. The complete distribution is listed below: tidyverse creative n prop base R 0 10 12.2% base R 1 53 64.6% base R 2 15 18.3% base R 3 2 2.4% base R NA 2 2.4% tidyverse 0 5 4.1% tidyverse 1 47 38.2% tidyverse 2 52 42.3% tidyverse 3 16 13.0% tidyverse 4 1 0.8% tidyverse NA 2 1.6% Warning in mutate_impl(.data, dots): Unequal factor levels: coercing to character Warning in mutate_impl(.data, dots): binding character and factor vector, coercing into character vector Warning in mutate_impl(.data, dots): binding character and factor vector, coercing into character vector The following subsections will dissect the similarities and differences between base R and tidyverse student projects for the four variables combined to form the creativity metric, as well as postulate reasons for the distributions. 6.1.1 Creation of New Variable(s) The largest difference in proportions for the four variables that make up the creativity metric is within the creation of new variable category. Nearly half of all final projects using the Tidyverse syntax featured a creation of a new variable, whereas less than a quarter of base R projects did. tidyverse create_new_var n proportion base R yes 18 22.0% tidyverse yes 59 48.0% This difference may be due to the easability in utilizing the Tidyverse’s mutate() function, which allows users to create new variables using just one command. In Base R, students are instructed to use $ notation, which may be construed as harder to grasp due to issues with variable selection with $ and its usage in other base R tasks than just creating new variables. In fact, it seems as though slightly more base R studies changed pre-existing variables. tidyverse change_var n prop base R yes 2 2.4% tidyverse yes 9 7.3% The mechanisms for doing so are not much more complicated in base R. An example of changing an existing studio variable to “Warner Bros. Studios” or “Other” is listed below in both Base R and the Tidyverse for comparison: Tidyverse: movies &lt;- movies %&gt;% mutate(studio = (if_else(studio == &quot;Warner Bros. Pictures&quot;, &quot;Warner Bros. Pictures&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;)) Base R: movies$studio &lt;- if_else(movies$studio == &quot;Warner Bros. Pictures&quot;, &quot;Warner Bros. Pictures&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;) The other two variables need to be re-inputted and updated, so the language and subsections remain below to avoid confusion. 6.1.2 Subgroup Analysis The presence of a form of a subgroup analysis was measured in regards to creativity. To score a 1 for this variable, projects analyzed a portion of the data for parts of their EDA. As an example, a project receiving a “yes” for this category may have analyzed how the audience ratings for R rated movies compared to that of PG-13 movies in their bivariate analysis. This variable has not been recoded yet. tidyverse sub_analysis n prop base R yes 65 79.3% tidyverse yes 115 93.5% 6.1.3 Subsetting dataset The final variable included in the creativity metric was the usage of a subset of the data for the entire analysis, such as analyzing solely PG movies for the scope of the analysis. This variable has also not been recoded yet fully, but it appears as though Tidyverse projects have a signficantly higher proportion. tidyverse sub_data n prop base R yes 4 4.9% tidyverse yes 20 16.3% Warning in mean.default(sub_data): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA Warning in mean.default(sub_data): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA Warning in var(if (is.vector(x) || is.factor(x)) x else as.double(x), na.rm = na.rm): NAs introduced by coercion Warning in var(if (is.vector(x) || is.factor(x)) x else as.double(x), na.rm = na.rm): NAs introduced by coercion # A tibble: 2 x 3 tidyverse mean sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 base R NA NA 2 tidyverse NA NA 6.1.4 Overall theme As for a rough comparison of project quality, a new variable devised of a summation of a theme throughout the exploratory data analysis and the use of relevant and sufficient supporting data. (Could be facilitated by the tidyverse?) By the use of relevant and sufficient supporting data, the covariate seeks to address the issue that projects may have interesting themes but lack the analysis and coding quality to supplement their project. Thus, a category tracking relevant data, such as finding the correlation in a linear regression instead of merely plotting the two variables together, was created. Thus far, it appears as though a higher proportion of Tidyverse projects reach a certain quality. This may be due to the ease in using the Tidyverse suit of commands in a fashion that make the project easier to code as beginners in R. tidyverse theme n prop base R 0 12 14.6% base R 1 40 48.8% base R 2 28 34.1% base R NA 2 2.4% tidyverse 0 14 11.4% tidyverse 1 47 38.2% tidyverse 2 60 48.8% tidyverse NA 2 1.6% HERE’S THE DEPTH TABLE: Syntax | Mean | Standard Deviation ——— | —– ————- Base R | 1.2 | .7 Tidyverse | 1.4 | .8 Both variables within theme reflect this trend. A present theme throughout EDA is present in a greater proportion of Tidyverse projects. As an example, analyzing the impact of movie ratings on audience scores would be a sufficient theme, but referencing an assortment of different predictors would not register as one. tidyverse eda_theme n prop base R yes 47 57.3% tidyverse yes 88 71.5% The significant difference in couhts could be attributed to the select() function in the Tidyverse. Tidyverse projects also had a substantially higher margin of projects with relevant supplmenetary data analyses. tidyverse rel_data n prop base R yes 49 59.8% tidyverse yes 79 64.2% 6.1.5 Grades NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW Not important: When analyzing the difference in grade distributions between Tidyverse and Base R courses, the Base R ones are not significantly higher. Upon a closer look at individual semesters, though, it is clear that the Fall 2013 grade distribution is significantly higher than any of the others, and thus, it makes sense to scale the grade variable by semester. tidyverse mean(grade, na.rm = TRUE) sd(grade, na.rm = TRUE) base R 87.00366 5.089191 tidyverse 85.39187 6.245439 sem mean(grade, na.rm = TRUE) sd(grade, na.rm = TRUE) Fall 2013 89.76087 2.587160 Fall 2014 85.29333 4.575190 Fall 2015-Section 01 85.45000 7.871679 Fall 2015-Section 06 86.06667 4.425111 Spring 2015 86.58621 6.198889 Spring 2016-Section 002 81.54333 6.639936 Spring 2016-Section 01 88.06571 3.951541 "]

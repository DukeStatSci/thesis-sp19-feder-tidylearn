# Final Project

The final project simulates a complete data analysis using relevant techniques 
covered throughout the STA 101 curriculum. It is the second of two projects 
groups completed, but differs drastically from the frst. Whereas the first project
focuses on statistical inference and the dataset description, the second one is 
more comprehensive in its requirements, requiring EDA and regression sections, as
well as more creativity to address the final project's directives. In the final
project, student groups simulate a task at a new music studio where their boss 
hypothetically assigns two goals: they want to learn about the attributes that 
make a movie popular and also something new about movies. 

The final project contains five components—an introduction, a univariate analysis, 
a bivariate analysis, a multiple regression for predicting audience scores, and a 
conclusion. The regression section is relatively constant amongst groups in
determining an optimal regression. However, in the univariate and bivariate 
analyses, student groups can explore a variety of different options, often
differentiating between the relative strengths of the projects. Should I include
an example in the appendix?

The student project dataset has been nearly constant throughout this analysis, 
and it tracks a random sample of American movies released since 1970. The student
project dataset contains between 25 and 32 variables summmarizing the movie's 
general characteristics, such as runtime, genre, and production studio, award 
trackers, such as best picture, best actor, best actress and best director
indicator variables, as well as data from an online film review website (Rotten 
Tomatoes) and an online movie database (IMDB). Although variables such as the 
producing studio, the month and day of the week of both the theatre and DVD releases, 
IMDB rating (out of 10) and audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes are not included 
in the original 2013 dataset, student groups were provided with a sufficient 
amount of potential variables to analyze. The student project dataset's most recent 
codebook, directly copied from the Spring 2016 project assignment, is available 
in the appendix.

# Student Groups

Students reamined in the same groups they were assigned at the beginning of 
the semester since the groups were crafted based on the results of both a pre-test
and a survey. Both the pre-test and the survey were geared toward understanding 
each individual's statistical background and literacy upon entering the course. 
Students worked through each lab assignment together, which consisted of exercises
in R, and were encouraged to study together for exams as well.

# Dataset Background

The dataset has been manually compiled from 205 STA 101 final group projects 
spanning the 2013-2016 academic years. The projects' contents are located on Duke's
Sakai sites of seven different classes, six of which were taught by Dr. 
Cetinkaya-Rundel. The submitted file(s) for the project consisted of either R 
Markdown or scripts of their project code.

The dataset utilized in this paper primarily focuses on actions taken by groups 
within the univariate and bivariate portions of the projects. In doing so, the
the dataset contains variables summarizing relative creativity measures, as well
as the projects' depth. Explanations of each variable will be available in the 
following chapter.

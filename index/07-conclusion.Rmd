# Conclusion {-}

Due to the discrepancies in creativity, depth, and multivariate visualization 
scores between students projects using base R and others employing the tidyverse
syntax, we recommend that the tidyverse syntax should be the primary syntax when
using R as a supplement for introductory statistics courses. Although the sample
is limited by solely analyzing Duke's STA 101 final projects, the standardization
of STA 101 classes provides an optimal baseline for comparison. Another potential
source of bias, the project assignment document, can be nullified by the lack of
wording differences since the Fall 2013 document (a base R class). As such, since
there was shown to be higher scores in the three metrics for projects using the 
tidyverse syntax, the project language is not considered to be a confounding 
variable.

Since we could not find a significant confounding factor, we can attribute the 
distinctions in creativity, depth, and multivariate visualization scores to the 
R syntax. Additionally, since the final projects were randomly scored by course,
and then later checked, we are confident that there was no bias in the coding of
the indicator variables. We confirmed tough scoring situations through 
collaboration between Mr. Feder and Dr. Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and based on the 
guidelines outlined in Methods, the differences between scoring a one and zero 
for the various indicator variables should be distinct.

We encourage instructors to teach introductory R using the tidyverse syntax, as
well as the inclusion of `infer` for inference tasks. We believe that the 
tidyverse's consistency encourages students to produce more creative and higher
quality work while tightly adhering to the GAISE. We hope the educational 
resources created as a result of this study will have far-reaching impacts within
the statistical community and will become staples for R users in the future.

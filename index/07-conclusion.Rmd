FUTURE WORK

-he imagines that if you first learn with tidy verse, students aren’t becoming real R programmers, might want to look at that look for “function(){“
-if we took code for base R and tidy verse and gave them to students who have never seen code, might be able to read tidy verse code easier to read first 
*in the future, might be able to look at this

Due to the discrepancies in creativity, depth, and multivariate visualization 
scores between students projects using base R and others employing the tidyverse
syntax, we recommend that the tidyverse syntax should be the primary syntax when
using R as a supplement for introductory statistics courses. Although the sample
is limited by solely analyzing Duke's STA 101 final projects, the standardization
of STA 101 classes provides an optimal baseline for comparison. Another potential
source of bias, the project assignment document, can be nullified by the lack of
wording differences since the Fall 2013 document (a base R class) supplemented
by a similar creativity metric distribution for the Fall 2013 class as other
base R section. As such, since
there was shown to be higher scores in the three metrics for projects using the 
tidyverse syntax, the project language is not considered to be a confounding 
variable.

For our scoring mechanism, initially, we inputted the grades received for the 
assignment prior to coding the indicator variables. However, after the first two
classes were coded, we recognized that the grades might provide a potential source
of error, so the grades were subsequently inputted for all future projects after
the entire submission was scored. In an attempt to fully expell any bias, we 
confirmed the variable coding a second time while ignoring the grades received,
and tough scoring situations were confirmed via collaboration between Mr. Feder
and Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel.

Since we could not find a significant confounding factor, we can attribute the 
distinctions in creativity, depth, and multivariate visualization scores to the 
R syntax. Additionally, since the final projects were randomly scored by course,
and then later checked, we are confident that there was no bias in the coding of
the indicator variables

We strongly encourage instructors to teach introductory R using the tidyverse syntax,
as well as `infer` for inference tasks, as we believe that the 
tidyverse's consistency encourages students to produce more creative and higher
quality work while tightly adhering to the GAISE. We decided to create educational
materials instead of attempting a form of modeling due to our desire to contribute
to the current introductory statistics curriculum.

## Future Work

We encourage others to build upon this analysis in an experimental form, since
this study is solely retrospective. Although we have attempted to eliminate all
potential sources of bias, a causal analysis can be much more unambiguous in a
randomized trial. Perhaps similar to the study performed by [@myint2019comparison],
a randomized experiment conducted through an online educational company, instead
focusing on distinct code differences, could be very effective.

In the future, it may be interesting to show tidyverse and base R code snippets
accomplishing the same tasks to students with no programming background to determine
whether one syntax is easier to initially read and understand. Also, as the `infer`
package grows in popularity, the effectiveness of the `infer` package in completing
inference tasks should be confirmed.

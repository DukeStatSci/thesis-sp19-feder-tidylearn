# Introduction

At Duke University, STA 101 is the primary introductory statistics course, 
where students are assumed to have entered the class without any statistical 
knowledge. The majority of students enrolled in the course do not plan on 
enrolling in future statistics curricula, focusing the course on applications of
statistics, as students learn how to relate STA 101's concepts to their future 
works.

At the beginning of the course, the students are divided into groups where they 
complete assignments throughout the course together. The class is split into seven
units, and every section has at least one lab, taught in R, to bolster the 
learning segment. 

For introductory statistics courses, the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction
in Statistics Education (GAISE) sets the standard, as it provides a set of general
recommendations, as well as specific goals to be accomplished by the course's 
completion. With its updated version released in 2016, the GAISE, which is 
endorsed by the American Statistical Association, recommends that students use 
programming, if accessible, to explore real-world examples of concepts covered 
in the classroom.

To conclude the semester, students display their grasp of the course through a 
group project conducted in R. A sufficient project submission adheres to seven 
of the nine stated goals of the GAISE, which are listed in the literature review
section. The project, while constrained to a specific dataset, is relatively 
open-ended, as groups can analyze various features of the data.

Due to the flexibility promoted within the project, students are encouraged to 
display aspects of creativity in their analyses, whether it is focusing on Warner
Bros. Entertainment Inc. movies, or assembling an indicator variable for if the 
film received a nomination for best actor or actress. Creativity often stems 
from the exploratory data analysis process, where groups can uncover interesting
aspects to further scrutinize before beginning the analysis portion of the project.

Since the majority of students will *apply* these concepts in their future work,
statistical programming can be a useful skill to acquire, as it also provides students
with a platform to individually explore datasets in the future. The most popular one 
in the scope of statistics is R, which has become widely used in the field. When
using R to supplement the course, there are two prevailing, and competing, 
techniques for beginners. Students are instructed to work with either a relatively
new suite of packages called the tidyverse, or base R commands that have been in
use for far longer. The tidyverse was created to make coding in R more consistent,
but it has less of an internet community due to its relatively young age. At the
University, STA 101 classes have been taught distinctly using one or the other, 
creating an optimal platform to analyze the differences when using these syntaxes.

Does one coding syntax encourage a certain level of creativity while simultaneously
adhering to the GAISE recommendations and guidelines? That is the question this 
study seeks to discover through the analysis of these group projects, which are 
available using both base R and tidyverse methods.

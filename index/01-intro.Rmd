# Introduction

STA 101 is the primary introductory statistics course at Duke University, 
where students are assumed to have entered the class without any statistical 
knowledge. The majority of students enrolled in the course do not plan on 
enrolling in future statistics curricula, focusing the course on applications of
statistics, as students learn how to relate STA 101's concepts to their future 
works.

At the beginning of the course, the students are divided into permanent groups 
where they complete assignments together. The class is split into seven
units, and every module is supplemented by at least one lab, taught in R, to 
bolster the learning segment. 

For introductory statistics education, the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction
in Statistics Education (GAISE) sets quality and scope standards, as it provides
a set of general recommendations, as well as specific goals to be accomplished by 
the course's completion. In its 2016 updated version, the GAISE, 
which is endorsed by the American Statistical Association, recommends that 
students use programming, if accessible, to explore real-world examples of the subjects
covered in the classroom [@carver2016guidelines].

To conclude the STA 101 semester, students display their grasp of the concepts by
completing a group project conducted in R. A sufficient project submission adheres
to seven of the nine stated goals of the GAISE [@carver2016guidelines]. The 
project, while constrained to a specific dataset, is relatively 
open-ended, as groups can analyze various features of the data.

Due to the flexibility promoted by the project assignment, students are encouraged to 
display aspects of creativity in their analyses, whether it is focusing on Warner
Bros. Entertainment Inc. movies, or assembling an indicator variable tracking if a member
of the film received a nomination for best actor or actress. Creativity often stems 
from the exploratory data analysis process, where groups can uncover interesting
aspects to further scrutinize before beginning the analysis portion of the project.

Since the majority of students will *apply* these concepts in their future work,
statistical programming provides students with a legitimate platform to individually
explore datasets. When using R as a course supplement, there are two 
prevailing and competing techniques for beginners [@robinsonteach, @leek2016don].
Students are instructed to work with either a relatively new suite of packages 
called the tidyverse or base R commands that have been in use for far longer. 
The tidyverse was created to make coding in R more consistent, but it does not 
contain as many internet resources, such as debugging responses on Stack Overflow,
as base R. 

At Duke University, the programming aspect of STA 101 classes have been taught in
either base R or the tidyverse syntax, creating an optimal platform to diagnose
the direct affects of the syntax. Through the analysis of R code from STA 101 
final group projects, we hope to uncover if one programming syntax encourages 
a more advanced level of creativity while simultaneously adhering to the GAISE
recommendations and guidelines.

A study released March 3, 2019 attempted to uncover the answer to a similar question,
as it analyzed the difference in visualization quality between base R plots and 
`ggplot2`, a package within the tidyverse, for beginning R programmers [@myint2019comparison].
Although the evaluation favored visualizations crafted using `ggplot2`, it focused
on the output of the code, rather than the code quality. This study concerns the code
itself, and whether beginning coders were encouraged to be more creative and
produce higher-quality final projects based on the syntax.

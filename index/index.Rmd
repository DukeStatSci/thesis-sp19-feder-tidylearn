Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!
If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.
If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

I thank my advisor, Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel for her immense dedication and 
support in supervising this project. I could not have done this without her, let
alone obtain a legitimate dataset to perform a comparative analysis. I also thank
Dr. Victoria Ellison for her essential advice, and the Department of Statistical
Science for providing me with the tools to complete this project. Most of all, 
I thank my family and friends for their love and belief in me for the past 21 years.

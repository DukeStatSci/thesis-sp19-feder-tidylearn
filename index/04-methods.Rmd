# Data Background

The dataset is manually compiled from STA 101 final projects since 2013. The 
provided data for the projects has been constant throughout this analysis, and 
it tracks a random sample of American movies released since 1970. The provided 
datset contains variables regarding the movie's general characteristics, such as 
runtime, genre, and production studio, award trackers, as well as audience and
critic ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and statistics from its IMDB page.

These projects have five componentsâ€”an introduction, univariate analysis, 
bivariate analysis, multiple regression in predicting audience scores, and a 
conclusion. The regression section is relatively constant amongst groups in
determining an optimal regression. However, in the univariate and bivariate 
analyses, student groups can explore a variety of different options, often
differentiating between the relative strengths of the projects.

An example of a complete project assignment is available in the Appendix.

The dataset utilized in this paper primarily focuses on actions taken by groups 
within the univariate and bivariate portions of the projects. In doing so, the
dataset contains variables aimed at summarizing relative creativity measures, 
as well as grade performance and completeness of the assignments.

Explanations of specific variables will be available in the following section.

Note: I have not gone back through and separated the column that used to be 
subsetting the data. That column has been changed to one tracking a subgroup 
analysis, and the other as using a subset of the data for the entire project. 
In the meantime, I have set the NAs for the subgroup analysis to 0 for the 
purpose of analyzing the creative variable.
